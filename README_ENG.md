## Why OpenProxy?

Governance risk is at the heart of the Korea Discount. As passive investing grows, the meaning of share ownership is fading — yet the risk itself is becoming sharper. Accessing and analyzing governance data quickly should be easy, but reading through hundreds of pages of regulatory filings takes more time and expertise than most people have.

**OpenProxy breaks down that barrier using AI.** It converts DART filings into structured data, so anyone can analyze ownership structure, dividend history, AGM agendas, and proxy contests in seconds.

## Main Features

Click any feature for a detailed page (pages are in Korean).

- **[AGM proxy voting](docs/features/proxy-voting.md)** — structures the AGM notice (소집공고) agenda items and returns a per-item FOR / AGAINST / REVIEW recommendation with rationale.
- **[Control-contest signals](docs/features/control-contest.md)** — gathers proxy solicitation, tender offer, litigation, and 5%-block activism signals (no auto-verdict — it lists information, the analyst decides).
- **[Ownership map](docs/features/ownership.md)** — largest shareholder, related parties, 5% blocks, and treasury shares — the real size of control.
- **[AGM agenda](docs/features/meeting-agenda.md)** — agenda items, director nominees, compensation limits, articles amendments, plus post-AGM results and approval rates.
- **[Shareholder return](docs/features/shareholder-return.md)** — dividends, the treasury buyback-to-cancellation cycle, and value-up plans, comparing what was promised against what was actually executed.
- **[Financial metrics](docs/features/financials.md)** — DART financial endpoints unified into ROE, stability, and cash-flow metrics (plus DuPont breakdown and audit-opinion trend).

Other capabilities — source tracing, corporate governance report, dilutive issuance, restructuring, related-party transactions — are in the [16-tool catalog](wiki/tools/README.md).

## Quick Start

### Step 0: Check supported clients and access requirements

OpenProxy MCP is deployed as a **remote MCP server**. You can connect it from Claude web and ChatGPT web surfaces that support custom connectors / MCP apps.

- **Claude**: a paid plan with custom connector support is required.
- **ChatGPT**: a plan and workspace/developer permission that supports custom connectors / MCP apps may be required.

> **Note**:
> - Actual menus depend on plan, workspace permissions, and feature rollout state.
> - ChatGPT integration assumes a **remote MCP server**, not a local MCP process.

### Step 1: Get a DART API key (required)

All data in OpenProxy comes from DART OpenAPI. **You need your own API key to use it.**

1. Go to [DART OpenAPI](https://opendart.fss.or.kr/) and create an account
2. Request an authentication key — it's free and issued immediately

### Step 2: Connect

Once you have the API key, choose one of the two options below.

#### Option A: Claude web custom connector (no installation, takes 30 seconds)

Append your DART API key to the URL. The key is only used server-side and is never exposed to the AI.

**claude.ai web:**

1. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) → Settings → Connectors
2. Select "Add custom connector"
3. Name: `open-proxy-mcp`, enter the URL:
```
https://open-proxy-mcp.fly.dev/mcp?opendart=YOUR_API_KEY
```
4. Click "Add" → 16 tools are automatically recognized
5. Go to the connector settings → Permissions → select **"Always allow"** (tools run automatically without per-call approval)

> **Note**: If tools have been added or updated, it may take a moment for the connector to sync. Remove the connector and re-add it to get the latest tools immediately. Open a new chat after reconnecting.

#### Option B: ChatGPT web custom connector / MCP app (beta)

ChatGPT web can also connect to remote MCP servers through custom connector / MCP app surfaces when available to your account.

1. Open ChatGPT web
2. Confirm developer mode or custom connector creation permission
3. Go to `Settings -> Apps & Connectors -> Create`
   or `Workspace Settings -> Connectors -> Create`
4. Name: `open-proxy-mcp`
5. MCP server URL:
```
https://open-proxy-mcp.fly.dev/mcp?opendart=YOUR_API_KEY
```
6. Choose the authentication mode
7. Save, then select the connector/app in a new chat

> **Note**:
> - ChatGPT custom connector / MCP app availability depends on plan, workspace permission, and beta rollout.
> - This is a custom MCP server, so organizations may need separate review before use.

### Usage examples

Once connected, just ask in natural language:

```
"Summarize Samsung Electronics' AGM agenda items"                # Integrated analysis (proxy_advise)
"Review independence of KB Financial's outside director candidates"  # Candidate evaluation
"Analyze the Korea Zinc proxy contest"                            # Contest signals
"Show Samsung Electronics' ownership structure"                   # Ownership + control map
"SK Hynix dividend history"                                       # Dividend + quarterly breakdown
"Find KOSPI companies that cancelled treasury shares in last 30 days"  # Treasury screening
"Lotte Chemical 2024 YoY + accounting risk alerts"                # Financials + audit opinion
"KT&G corporate governance report compliance rate"                # Governance 15 principles
"Create a KT&G AGM voting memo"                                   # Open Proxy Guideline recommendation
```

| Layer | Tools | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Company | `company` | Company identification and common filings index |
| Meeting | `shareholder_meeting_notice`, `shareholder_meeting_results` | Pre/post AGM data |
| Data | `ownership_structure`, `financial_metrics`, `corp_gov_report`, `dividend`, `treasury_share`, `value_up`, `corporate_restructuring`, `dilutive_issuance`, `proxy_contest`, `related_party_transaction` | Filing, financial, ownership, and governance parsers |
| Evidence | `evidence` | Source tracking from filing receipt numbers |
| Action | `proxy_advise_before_meeting`, `proxy_result_after_meeting` | Compose multiple data tools into recommendations/reports |

> Each tool's scope, options, data sources, and validation results: see catalog at **[wiki/tools/README.md](wiki/tools/README.md)** or per-tool pages (`wiki/tools/{name}.md`).

### Voting Policy — Open Proxy Guideline

`proxy_advise_before_meeting` uses the OPM **Open Proxy Guideline** by default:

- 12 categories × 116 rules + 11 novel topics + **7 new 2026 Korea law rules**
- 4 principles: minority shareholder protection / governance transparency / long-term value / traceability
- 38 legal-layer rules covering Commercial Act amendments and articles-of-incorporation bypass scenarios
- An anonymized institutional policy corpus is used only as internal cross-reference. User-facing responses do not expose institution names or identifiers.

**Every data tool returns `data.usage`**: DART API call count + MCP tool call count, so you can track how much of the 1,000/min DART limit each query consumes.

```
Usage pattern: start with `company` → confirm facts via data tabs → generate action outputs
```

## Voting Criteria

When you ask for a voting recommendation on an AGM agenda item, OpenProxy returns FOR / AGAINST / REVIEW from the **information inside DART filings only** — it does not check external news or reputation.

**AGAINST is reserved for hard triggers.** Only four conditions produce AGAINST: capital impairment (full), qualified/adverse audit opinion, director disqualification, and audit-committee long tenure. Every other concern returns REVIEW (OpenProxy flags it; the analyst decides) — never an automatic AGAINST.

| Agenda type | FOR | REVIEW | AGAINST |
|-------------|-----|--------|---------|
| Financial statements | Clean audit opinion + no impairment | Data not confirmed (NO_DATA) | Full capital impairment / qualified-adverse opinion |
| **Outside director election** | Independence + no disqualification | Independence concern (largest-shareholder tie / dealing with company / former employee) / long tenure / prior accounting-risk history | Disqualification / (audit committee) long tenure |
| **Inside director re-election** | No disqualification + tenure performance good/moderate | Tenure performance weak **or bad** (not a legal disqualification → user review) | Disqualification |
| Inside director (new) | No disqualification (no tenure → performance N/A) | — | Disqualification |
| Compensation limit | Utilization reasonable / cut / minor change | Low utilization yet increase / 50%+ large increase / earnings slowdown + increase | (none) |
| Articles amendment | Formal / minority-protection wording / fiduciary duty | Removes cumulative voting / supermajority / board-size cut / authorized-shares increase | (none) |
| Treasury shares | Cancellation (shareholder return) | Disposal (possible friendly stake) | (none) |
| Dividend | Profit + sound capital / REIT | Loss / impairment / payout > 200% | (none) |

### Inside director tenure performance matrix (2x3)

Auto-FOR for company-nominated inside directors (only checking disqualification) creates status-quo bias. To counter this, OpenProxy scores each inside director's **tenure-period operating performance** across 6 cells:

| Metric | avg | trend |
|---|---|---|
| **ROE** | average score | trend score |
| **Debt ratio** | average score | cumulative-change score over tenure |
| **CSR** (dividend + cancellation / net income) | average score | trend score |

Each cell: good +2 / moderate +1 / weak 0 / bad -1. Total: +7 or above = good / +3 to +6 = moderate / 0 to +2 = weak / below 0 = bad. Grade maps to the vote as **good/moderate → FOR, weak/bad → REVIEW** (a bad grade is not a legal disqualification, so it never auto-produces AGAINST).

**Special rules**: capital impairment (full) auto-bads ROE/leverage avg / loss + return activity → CSR weak (accelerates impairment) / loss + no return → CSR moderate (conservatism).

Validated on KOSPI 100 + KOSDAQ 50 (n=128): G1 classification coverage 100%, distribution good 29.7% / mod 45.3% / weak 18.0% / bad 7.0% (all within target bands).

## Release notes (v2.0)

First stable release. The `tools_v2` toolset ships 16 public tools covering Korean listed-company governance analysis end to end.

- **16 public tools** — Company → Meeting/Data/Evidence → Action flow.
- **Control-contest signals** (`proxy_contest`) — 4-stage litigation classification + dedup, 5% holding dynamics (purpose shift, sustained accumulation), external-raider vs insider split.
- **Disclosure-type code index** — `pblntf_ty`/`pblntf_detail_ty` → actual disclosure mapping ([wiki](wiki/rules/disclosures/공시유형코드체계.md)). Searches narrow by detail code first (dividends = `I001`, etc.).
- **Shareholder-return tracking** — dividends/treasury/value-up in one view.
- **Financial & governance checks** — DART financial endpoints + corporate governance report.
- **Reliability** — DART 1,000/min rolling-window hard guard (cap 910), 3-tier fallback (XML→PDF→OCR), full source tracing (`data.usage` + receipt numbers).

Next items (tracked internally): financial-statement footnote parsing (related-party, contingencies, segments), detail-code search rollout.
