# Release Notes

Version history for OpenProxy MCP. [한국어](RELEASE_NOTES.md)

## Since v2.1 (unreleased, 2026-06-12 ~ )

- **financial_metrics period handling** — DART reports carry different period semantics per item (income statement `thstrm` = current 3 months, cumulative is `thstrm_add`; cash flow = cumulative; balance sheet = point-in-time). For interim reports the tool now ① computes P&L on two bases — cumulative (YTD) plus current-quarter standalone (half/Q3 derived by differencing the prior report), ② computes turnover days (DSO/DIO/CCC) on a TTM (trailing-12-month) denominator to remove single-quarter annualization distortion (SK Hynix 26Q1 DIO 511→133 days; DSO false 38.6→61.4), ③ leaves ROE/ROA un-annualized (period value), and ④ always states the basis via `period_basis`/`turnover_basis`/`basis_note`. Also: evidence now carries the source report rcept/viewer URL, a warning when consolidated (CFS) is unavailable and standalone (OFS) is used, a quarter-aware default year for quarterly/qoq, and operating-margin QoQ/YoY in %p.
- **ownership_structure / proxy_contest co-holding classification** — parses the 5% holding report's summary table to split the filer from related parties; when related parties include the registry's largest shareholder the block is reclassified as `coheld_with_registry` (prevents mislabeling an ally as an external party).
- **Removed `proxy_result_after_meeting` (17→16 tools)** — the core (per-agenda pass/fail and vote rates) is served by `shareholder_meeting_results` with far fewer calls. Follow-up filings, contest, and governance context chain through direct tool calls.
- **Full tool-by-tool audit completed** — beyond parse success rates: value accuracy, units, composite seams, render layer, and production. Ownership across 450 companies (self-correcting DART source unit contamination), value accuracy across 286, corp_gov reference match across 30, 31 render cases, production MCP smoke.
- **Fixed a silent proxy_result regression** — agenda results were always empty due to an unsynced upstream key rename (verified fixed before removal).
- **proxy_advise robustness** — fixed crashes on string headcounts in compensation parsing and None formatting in the performance matrix.

## v2.1

17-tool lineup. Centered on risk-event tracking and natural-language routing improvements.

- **New `risk_events` tool (17th)** — serious accidents, embezzlement/breach of trust, and production halts in one view. With no company given, scans the whole market for the last 30 days. Verified against 305 companies x 3.5 years (zero search diff) and 359 full-text parses.
- **`related_party_transaction` → `corporate_deals`** — fixed tool-routing misses on "acquired/sold" natural-language queries by renaming and rewording the tool description.
- **`ownership_structure` precision** — 100% reconciliation of total shares (registry + treasury + others), registry top holder vs actual 5% blockholder split, contest-aware 5% change tracking.
- **`dividend` precision** — quarterly DPS derived from periodic-report cumulative differencing, 100% consistency across 51 companies.
- **`financial_metrics` precision** — fixed Q4 rows carrying full-year cumulative figures; all quarters are now standalone three-month values with QoQ/YoY attached by default. Interest-coverage distortion (total finance costs leaking into the denominator) removed with coverage expanded to 97%; borrowings and quarterly cash flow restored. Financial firms and mid-year restatements are auto-flagged. Verified across 412 companies x 2 fiscal years (KOSPI top 300, KOSDAQ top 100).

## v2.0

First stable release. The `tools_v2` toolset ships 16 public tools covering Korean listed-company governance analysis end to end.

- **16 public tools** — Company → Meeting/Data/Evidence → Action flow.
- **Control-contest signals** (`proxy_contest`) — 4-stage litigation classification + dedup, 5% holding dynamics (purpose shift, sustained accumulation), external-raider vs insider split.
- **Disclosure-type code index** — `pblntf_ty`/`pblntf_detail_ty` → actual disclosure mapping ([wiki](../wiki/rules/disclosures/공시유형코드체계.md)). Searches narrow by detail code first (dividends = `I001`, etc.).
- **Shareholder-return tracking** — dividends/treasury/value-up in one view.
- **Financial & governance checks** — DART financial endpoints + corporate governance report.
- **Reliability** — DART 1,000/min rolling-window hard guard (cap 910), 3-tier fallback (XML→PDF→OCR), full source tracing (`data.usage` + receipt numbers).

Next items (tracked internally): financial-statement footnote parsing (related-party, contingencies, segments), detail-code search rollout.
